        Calculates the iptables update to rewrite our chains.

        To avoid traversing lots of dispatch rules to find the right one,
        we build a tree of chains.  Currently, the tree can only be
        two layers deep: a root chain and a layer of leaves.

        Interface names look like this: "prefix1234abc".  The "prefix"
        part is always the same so we ignore it.  We call "1234abc", the
        "suffix".

        The root chain contains two sorts of rules:

        * where there are multiple interfaces whose suffixes start with
          the same character, it contains a rule that matches on
          that prefix of the "suffix"(!) and directs the packet to a
          leaf chain for that prefix.

        * as an optimization, if there is only one interface whose
          suffix starts with a given character, it contains a dispatch
          rule for that exact interface name.

        For example, if we have interface names "tapA1" "tapB1" "tapB2",
        we'll get (in pseudo code):

        Root chain:

        if interface=="tapA1" then goto chain for endpoint tapA1
        if interface.startswith("tapB") then goto leaf chain for prefix "tapB"
